## BUG-001 — "+ Add Quick Link" Text Overlaps Plane AI Promotional Text on Mobile Browser

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| ID | BUG-001 |
| Severity | Medium |
| Type | UI / Responsive Layout Bug |
| Module | Home Page |
| Component | Quicklinks Section / Plane AI Section |
| Status | Open |
| Reported To | [makeplane/plane#9084](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/issues/9084) |
| Date | 2026-05-15 |

### Description
On the Plane.so home page, when accessed via mobile Chrome browser, the **"+ Add quick Link"** button text from the Quicklinks section visually overlaps with the **Plane AI promotional text** ("Use Build mode to create work items, Cycles and more."). This creates visual confusion as two separate UI elements render on top of each other.

The issue is **specific to mobile browser layout** and does not occur in desktop mode.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Chrome browser on a mobile device
2. Navigate to https://app.plane.so
3. Sign in with your account
4. Observe the Home page immediately after login
5. Look at the area between the **Plane AI** section and the **Quicklinks** section

### Expected Result
The "+ Add quick Link" button and the Plane AI promotional text should be clearly separated with proper spacing, rendering in their own distinct sections without any visual overlap.

### Actual Result
The "+ Add quick Link" text overlaps with the Plane AI description text, causing two UI elements from different sections to visually merge on mobile viewport.

### Desktop vs Mobile Comparison

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Desktop browser | ✅ No overlap — layout renders correctly |
| Mobile Chrome browser | ❌ Overlap occurs — sections bleed into each other |

### Environment
| Field | Details |
